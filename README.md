# 2D Pixel Art

## About
- This project was created to showcase my growing abilities in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a basic website titled "2D Pixel Art," inspired by "Pixilart.com," where users can create and export pixel art. Unlike "Pixilart.com," this project focuses on fundamental features built solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without external libraries.

- The main takeaway from this project is the power of JavaScript in creating interactive and dynamic web experiences. It has deepened my understanding of how these languages collaborate to manipulate webpage elements, handle user input, and bring creative ideas to life. While it may not match the sophistication of more advanced tools, it demonstrates my foundational skills in web development. I am eager to expand my knowledge and explore advanced techniques and libraries in future projects.

- One limitation of this project is its reliance solely on mouse inputs, as it utilizes event listeners designed for mouse interaction. Touch inputs are not currently supported but may be considered for future implementation. Additionally, the webpage is not responsive, meaning it is not optimized for smaller devices. A special message alerts users if a small screen size is detected, informing them of the issue.

## Conclusion
- This project has been a significant learning experience, allowing me to apply and improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. While it has its limitations, it serves as a solid foundation for my journey in web development. I look forward to enhancing this project by adding support for touch inputs and making the webpage responsive. Additionally, I am excited to continue learning and applying more advanced techniques and libraries in future projects.

## Work in Progress
- Optimize JavaScript where applicable
