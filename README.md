# 2D-Pixel-Art

# About
- This project was created to showcase my growing abilities in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a basic website titled "2D-Pixel-Art," inspired by "Pixilart.com," where users can create and export pixel art. Unlike "Pixilart.com," this project is basic in functionality, focusing on fundamental features built solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without external libraries.
- The main takeaway from this project is the power of JavaScript in creating interactive and dynamic web experiences. It has deepened my understanding of how these languages collaborate to manipulate webpage elements, handle user input, and bring creative ideas to life. While it may not match the sophistication of more advanced tools, it demonstrates my foundational skills in web development. I am eager to expand my knowledge and explore advanced techniques and libraries in future projects.
- One limitation of this project is its reliance solely on mouse inputs, as it utilizes event listeners designed for mouse interaction. Touch inputs are not currently supported but may be considered for future implementation.
- The webpage is not responsive, meaning it is not optimized for smaller devices. A special message alerts users if a small screen size is detected, informing them of the issue.
